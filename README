This contains a collection of over 400 Slackware-dedicated and/or
otherwise related wallpapers.

The images are placed in /usr/share/wallpapers and will be shown in
the KDE wallpaper chooser. Also, xscreensaver will automatically find
them there and use the images for screensavers like "Carousel".

There are three options:
The script can create symlinks for the background choosers of XFCE or
MATE or both, and also optionally add background images for LiLo.

MATE=yes Add support for the MATE Desktop
XFCE=yes Add support for the XFCE Desktop
LILO=yes This option will add background images for LiLo.
	These are installed to /boot/images.

Note about LiLo backgrounds;
LiLo backgrounds require that you edit your /etc/lilo.conf. The
settings for each background is in /boot/images named the same as the
image but with a .txt extension.

CREDITS:
I am not the author of these!
To track all the authors would be quite troublesome or impossible.
Therefore if someone recognised their work and (rightfully) wants to
be credited, please let me know!
