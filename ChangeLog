----------
* Restructure:
The archive now only includes the actual wallpapers for "installation".

The removed images are available as a separate archive.

I have also decided to break the archive up into separate "packs"
because the archive was getting huge, over 300MB. I believe the
benefits outweigh any drawbacks here for a few reasons;
 1. Saves bandwidth if you don't want the entire collection.
 2. Reduces build time if you don't want the entire collection.
 3. Reduces the size of the output package if you don't want the
 	entire collection.
There is no need for any options to add the different "packs", just have
the ones you want in the SlackBuilds directory and the SlackBuild will
know what to do.

* Options:
Added 3 options; LILO, MATE and XFCE.
LILO=yes will include background images for LILO.
	These are installed to /boot/images.
MATE=yes will add symlinks for the MATE DE
XFCE=yes will add symlinks for the XFCE DE

* LiLo addition:
If you choose to install the LiLo backgrounds, each one has a .txt
that accompanies it with the correct settings for bitmap, bmp-colors,
bmp-table and bmp-timer that need to be set in /etc/lilo.conf.
